The files contain some example measurements of heights for various boys between the ages of two and eights. The y-values are the heights measured in meters, and the x-values are the ages of the boys corresponding to the heights.

Each height and age tuple constitutes one training example  $(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}$ in our dataset. There are $m = 50$ training examples, and you will use them to develop a linear regression model.
